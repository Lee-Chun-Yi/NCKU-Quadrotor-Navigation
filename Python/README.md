# Python Module

This folder contains the Python-side implementation for real-time communication with Crazyflie 2.1. It receives control commands from MATLAB and sends them to the drone via Crazyradio PA using the `cflib` library.

---

## Folder Structure

* `control_system.py`

 Main script responsible for:

  - Receiving RPYT commands from MATLAB over UDP (port 8888)
  - Receiving 6DoF Vicon motion data (port 8889)
  - Sending control commands to Crazyflie at 100Hz via `cf.commander.send_setpoint()`
  - Handling startup signals, battery voltage monitoring, emergency landing, and cleanup

* `control_reference.md`

 A reference document summarizing key Python functions and links to relevant Crazyflie libraries and control examples. It provides guidance on using:

  - MotionCommander / PositionHlCommander
  - Logging and real-time data retrieval
  - Power management and low-level setpoint control



## Features

* Dual UDP input pipeline for Vicon and MATLAB
* Timing control for precise 100Hz signal dispatch
* Safety modules: smooth landing, port cleanup, battery check
* Easily extendable for future path tracking, logging, and data saving



## Dependencies

* Python â‰¥ 3.7
* `cflib` (Crazyflie Python library)
* `socket`, `struct`, `threading`, `time`, `os`
