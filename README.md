## Indoor Navigation of Quadrotors Using a Motion Capture System

[Indoor Navigation of Quadrotors Using a Motion Capture System ](https://github.com/Lee-Chun-Yi/NCKU-Quadrotor-Navigation/blob/c2292256f3e641feb2b8fff336402041ceb46454/Quadrotor%20Control%20System.md)focuses on developing a reliable indoor navigation system for quadrotors using **Vicon Tracker 3.10**. The motion capture system provides precise real-time positional and orientation data, enabling accurate control and navigation in confined indoor environments where GPS signals are unavailable or unreliable.
