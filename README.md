# Indoor Navigation of Quadrotors Using a Motion Capture System

This project focuses on developing a reliable and efficient indoor navigation system for quadrotors using **Vicon Tracker 3.10**. The motion capture system provides precise real-time positional and orientation data, enabling accurate control and navigation in confined indoor environments where GPS signals are unavailable or unreliable.
