**Key Features:**
- Size: 92 mm motor-to-motor  
- Weight: ~27g (with battery)  
- Open-source hardware & firmware  
- Bluetooth & radio communication  
- Support for sensor decks and extensions

##  Motion Capture Marker Deck 
ðŸ”— [Motion Capture Marker Deck â€“ Bitcraze](https://www.bitcraze.io/products/motion-capture-marker-deck/)

An add-on deck for motion capture systems like **Vicon** or **OptiTrack**, allowing sub-millimeter tracking accuracy.

**Used in this project for:**
- Real-time 6DoF position feedback  
- Replacing the onboard IMU  
- Accurate external pose estimation

##  Crazyradio PA 
ðŸ”— [Crazyradio PA â€“ Bitcraze](https://www.bitcraze.io/products/crazyradio-pa/)

A long-range 2.4GHz USB radio dongle used for communicating with Crazyflie over the **CRTP protocol**.

**Used in this project for:**
- Reliable wireless communication between Crazyflie and control PC  
- Supports up to 1Mbit/s data rate  
- Essential for real-time command and feedback when not using Bluetooth
  
# 2. Commander Framework
ðŸ”— [Commander setpoints documentation](https://www.bitcraze.io/documentation/repository/crazyflie-firmware/master/functional-areas/sensor-to-control/commanders_setpoints/)
ðŸ”— [Controllers in the Crazyflie](https://www.bitcraze.io/documentation/repository/crazyflie-firmware/master/functional-areas/sensor-to-control/controllers/)

The **Commander** is the firmware layer responsible for translating external setpoints (e.g., velocity, position, attitude) into flight control actions.  
This project bypasses the Crazyflie onboard controller and sends **PWM signals directly**, forming a fully custom outer-loop system.

# 3. Firmware and Software Resources
The following open-source Bitcraze repositories were used and referenced in this project:

-  [Crazyflie Firmware (C)](https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-firmware/tree/master)  
  Handles onboard attitude estimation, motor mixing, and stabilization.  
  Referenced for motor PWM logic and commander structure.

-  [Crazyflie Clients (Python GUI)](https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-clients-python)  
  Official PC GUI for controlling Crazyflie.  
  Used for early testing and packet format reference.

-  [Crazyflie Python Library](https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-lib-python)  
  Python API to send setpoints, read logs, and access low-level communication.  
  Extensively used in this project to build real-time control loops and interface with Vicon.
