## 3. Forcibly Closing a UDP Port (e.g., 52001 Occupied)

If a UDP port remains occupied due to a crashed process:

1. Open Command Prompt.
2. Run the following to find the process ID (PID) using port 52001:
```
netstat -ano | findstr :52001
```
3. Use the PID value from the output (e.g., 52112) to terminate the process:
```
taskkill /PID  52112 /F
```
