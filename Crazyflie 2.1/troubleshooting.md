# Troubleshooting Guide

## 1. Wireless Communication Failure or Parameter Errors (Reset to Default)

When attempting to connect, check if the **green LED** on the Crazyflie lights up:

- ‚úÖ If the green LED is on but the drone does not respond:
  - This means the connection was successful, but **initialization was not completed**.
  - Try **unplugging and replugging** the Crazyflie battery.

- ‚ùå If the green LED does **not** light up:
  1. Verify that the correct **radio URI** in the Python code is being used.
  2. Unplug and replug the **Crazyradio PA** dongle.
  3. Use **Zadig** to check and install the correct USB driver:

## 2. Crazyflie Unbalanced During Flight

### Case I. Crashes Immediately After Takeoff

If the Crazyflie crashes as soon as it lifts off and RPYT outputs appear normal, this likely indicates a **hardware fault**.

üîç **Step-by-step hardware inspection:**

1. **Propellers** ‚Äì Check for physical damage or cracks.  
2. **Motors** ‚Äì Listen for abnormal noise during rotation.  
3. **Motor mounts** ‚Äì Ensure they are securely fixed to the frame.  

To assist with diagnosis, use the `cfclient` software:

- Open the `Console` tab  
- Select **Propeller Test** to check individual motor response  


### Case II. Lifts Off Briefly Then Crashes

- This may be caused by **excessive RPYT output** from the controller.
- If this occurs **repeatedly**, it is recommended to re-check all hardware components as listed above.

### Case III. Drifts After Takeoff

- This behavior is **considered normal**, often due to pre-existing roll / pitch angle.

## 4. Firmware Recovery (M2 Blue LED Solid ON)

If your Crazyflie shows a **solid blue LED on M2 after power-up**, this means the firmware is corrupted and the system **cannot boot or connect wirelessly**.

To recover the firmware, follow the **cold boot procedure** using the official `cfclient`.

### üîß Cold Boot (Recovery Mode)

1. **Disconnect and power off** the Crazyflie.

2. Launch `cfclient` and go to:

   ```
   Crazyflie ‚Üí Bootloader
   ```

3. In the bootloader dialog, select the **"Cold boot (recovery)"** tab.

4. **Press and hold** the power button on the Crazyflie.

   * After a few seconds, the blue LED (M2) will **blink slowly** ‚Üí wireless bootloader stage.
   * Then it will **blink rapidly** ‚Üí USB bootloader stage.
   *  **Release the button immediately once the fast blink begins.**

5. Once the blue LED is blinking rapidly, the bootloader is active.

6. In the dialog, click **"Initiate bootloader cold boot."**

7. Select the firmware:

   * Either the **latest official release**, or
   * Manually browse to a `.bin` file from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-firmware/releases)

8. Click **"Program"**, wait until flashing completes.

9. Click **"Restart in firmware mode"** to reboot and exit recovery.
